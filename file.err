 Smartsizing is inactive while mapped meshing key is set.                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       8.969   TIME= 18:00:46
 After NUMMRG,NODE, node 317 (and possibly others) is associated with    
 more than one solid model entity.  Future commands which depend on the  
 node to solid model connectivity (meshing, mesh clearing, solid         
 boundary condition transfer, etc.) may not operate properly.            
 NUMMRG,KP may correct this problem.
